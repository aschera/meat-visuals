## Assignment Data Storytelling

### 1. General information
Your project submission will take the form of:
1) a report/dashboard in the Power BI Cloud service, plus 2) a supplementary file, in any
format, where you briefly describe:
a) What is the Data Storytelling (communication impact) you are attempting to deliver via this
report/dashboard.
b) Explain how you have structured your report/dashboard to deliver that impact
c) Explain for each of your visualizations:
a. Why did you choose that way to visualise and communicate the information?
b. How do you plan for that visualisation to support and help deliver the dashboard’s
overall impact.
d) Why do you believe your technical analysis is correct and what steps you took to confirm your
results.

As the focus of this assignment is on your ability to create and communicate impactful
stories via visualisations, you will have a large degree of artistic freedom regarding the
overall layout, designs, and forms of visualisations you choose to employ.
It is allowed to import additional information sources to the data, or even for you to add
information manually, if you believe it will provide extra clarity and meaning to the task (for
example, information about which continent a country belongs to).

Additionally, remember that if there is a lot of redundancy in the data, it is generally wise to
break up the material.

Finally, the assessment criteria are provided for you in section 3, which specifies the minimum
demands and requirements which will need to be implemented and convincingly presented
to receive either a G, VG, or Incomplete marking for this assignment.

### 2 Task description
**2.1 Assignment**
Your assignment is to study the data, to learn and explore the relationships between each of
the countries and various exported shipments, and to create visualisations which present a
I would say that cohesive understanding of what you have found and what you recommend as a result.
To help focus your work and to make it easier for you to craft an impactful, actionable, and
results-based presentation, I strongly recommend that you identify relatively early in your
data analysis:

1) a role for yourself and the company/organisation for whom you are working, and
2) the audience for whom you present the visualisations you have created.

**2.2 Data**
In the attached CSV files, you will find records about meat transactions between
several countries, one file for each country. In the columns therein you will find the
following information for each export transaction:
-  Sender - The country that exports the goods.
-  Receiver - The country that imports the goods.
-  Sender Budget - The annual budget the sending country has for imports.
-  Sender Expected Revenue - The expected annual gross revenue from meat exports.
-  Receiver Budget - The annual budget the recipient country has for imports.
-  Receiver Expected Revenue - The expected annual gross revenue from meat exports.
-  Meat type - Type of meat exported.
-  Meat price - The price per kilo for the type of meat exported.
-  Toxicity - Unfortunately, all meat in this assignment has some degree of toxicity in it(!)
• Day Number - Which day it is, measured from the start of the measurements.
• Discount - Different countries have different trade agreements between them. This factor
therefore determines the amount of the discounting levels in each export transaction.
